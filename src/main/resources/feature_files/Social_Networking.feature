Feature: Social_Networking
#  Imagine you are building a social network. Starting from simple functionality. Users are now able to make posts and comment on them.
#  You are working in the backend team that exposes the service: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ which has the following endpoints:
#
#  1. Make posts: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
#  2. Comment on posts: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments
#  3. List of users: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

  Scenario Outline: Get a specific Comment
    Given jsonplaceholder service is up and running
    When I search for comment with "<id>" with a GET method
    Then I should get status code of 200 and "<id>", "<name>" and "<email>"

    Examples:
      | id | name                          | email               |
